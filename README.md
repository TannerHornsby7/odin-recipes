# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
In this project, I built a basic recipe website to practice my use of HTML, GIT, and the Command Line Interface. I want to focus on using well structured, frequent commit messages to increase the maintainability of my code.

## Reflection
I got too excited to build and went too long without committing. For the future, I should commit every time I have a major change to the code (on commit after I changed index.html, one after I added the recipe directory and created lagagna.html, one after adding the image folder and the lasagna image, one after adding beef wellington recipe). I felt very comfortable using HTML though and am excited to improve. Definitley want to focus on good consistent commit messages!!!
